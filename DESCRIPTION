Description: We present a summary statistic-based method TARIF to identify proteins trans-regulated by multiple groups of genetic variants.  Using z-statistic for association between proteins and multiple groups of genetic variants, TARIF first performs a low-rank decomposition of the association matrix across multiple groups, as a sum of the shared effect sizes and group-specific effect sizes. Then it perform a sparse singular value decomposition to identify sets of proteins which exhibit strong contributions in the shared effects.
